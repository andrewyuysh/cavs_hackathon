# 2024 Cleveland Cavaliers Sport Business and Analytics Night Hackathon

## I. Introduction
In today's data-driven world, transactional data plays a crucial role across all industries, especially in the sport industry, by providing detailed insights into customer interactions and business operations. This type of data captures every aspect of a transaction, including the "who", "what", "when", and "where," which allows organizations to track trends, monitor performance, and make informed decisions in real-time. By understanding purchasing behaviors and preferences, businesses can tailor their offerings to meet the specific needs of their customers, ultimately driving growth and profitability.
